### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**JSeelva/JSeelva** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I am junior as a developer having recently used SQL, C# and React professionally.
I like challenges related to problem solving and user experience/ process efficiency improvement.

One year ago I started working as a Junior Full Stack Developer on a project , where I developed my
skills in SQL, C#, and React using the base libraries available. I also created and managed databases (tables, views, stored procedures, C# consoles to insert a process data) and adapted the API and FrontEnd of an internal portal which goal is presenting results mainly through dashboards that I created in Tableau.
My academic and professional background is on Communication Design (print and digital) and I also have studied UxUi Design.
