### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**JSeelva/JSeelva** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I am a beginner as a developer having recently learned SQL, C#, JavaScript, Angular from PRIMAVERA Academy. At this moment my goal is to find a team environment on which I can evolve as a developer.
As a beginner I would appreciate a little guidance for my first professional experience as a developer in order to fulfill my drive to learn the specific technologies and tools your software business need.

My academic and professional background is Communication Design (print and digital) and I also have studied UxUi Design. So in my new career path, Front-End seems like a guilty option to me but also where I believe my learning curve could be shorter. That said, I'm ready to face new challenges in the back-end spectrum.
